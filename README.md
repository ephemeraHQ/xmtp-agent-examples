# XMTP agent examples

This repository contains examples of agents that use the [XMTP](https://docs.xmtp.org/) network.

#### Why XMTP?

- **End-to-end & compliant**: Data is encrypted in transit and at rest, meeting strict security and regulatory standards.
- **Open-source & trustless**: Built on top of the [MLS](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/) protocol, it replaces trust in centralized certificate authorities with cryptographic proofs.
- **Privacy & metadata protection**: Offers anonymous or pseudonymous usage with no tracking of sender routes, IPs, or device and message timestamps.
- **Decentralized**: Operates on a peer-to-peer network, eliminating single points of failure.
- **Multi-agent**: Allows multi-agent multi-human confidential communication over MLS group chats.

> See [FAQ](https://docs.xmtp.org/intro/faq) for more detailed information.

## Getting started

### Environment variables

To run your XMTP agent, you must create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```tsx
WALLET_KEY= # the private key of the wallet
ENCRYPTION_KEY= # encryption key for the local database
XMTP_ENV= # local, dev, production
```

You can generate random xmtp keys with the following command:

```tsx
yarn gen:keys <name>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Running the `gen:keys` or `gen:keys <name>` command will append keys to your existing `.env` file.

### Work in local network

`Dev` and `production` networks are hosted by XMTP, while `local` network is hosted by yourself. Use local network for development purposes only.

- 1. Install docker
- 2. Start the XMTP service and database

```tsx
./dev/up
```

- 3. Change the .env file to use the local network

```tsx
XMTP_ENV = local;
```

## Concepts

> [!NOTE]
> For detailed XMTP Agent development guidelines, please refer to our [Cursor Rules documentation](/.cursor/README.md) which contains comprehensive coding standards and best practices for XMTP integration.
